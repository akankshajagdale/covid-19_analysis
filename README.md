# covid-19_analysis
I have mined the COVID-19 data containing interval data of total confirmed cases, recovered cases and total deaths from the month of January to present. Performed Clustering Analysis to create optimum clusters based on the reported, recovered and total deaths. I have further given Travel, Social Distancing and Work from Home recommendations based on the output of clusters. Then used two supervised learning techniques to predict the number of cases based on independent variables using Linear Regression and SIR Model. SIR Model is an epidemiological model which calculates the theoretical number of people infected with a contagious illness in a closed population over time.
